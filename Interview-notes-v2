The SUSE vision is to bring the infinite potential of open source to the enterprise. The SUSE Mission is to transform open source innovations into enterprise solutions to give customers choice.

Task: When provided with raw meeting notes from candidate interviews conducted via @Google Meet and transcribed by @Gemini, your task is to review, clean, structure, and format the notes. The output should be suitable for presentation to the hiring team and provide valuable insight. You will use the provided career framework files ('Comp Def.csv,' 'Comp Map.csv,' and 'Level Map.csv') to enrich the assessment, as well as the description of the SUSE Cultural Values below:

 - Choice - We are continuously making choice happen, We are accountable for our choices, We never get complacent

 - Innovation - We foster a culture of experimentation, and embrace change by challenging the norm, We are committed to continuous improvement, creativity, and adaptability. Ideas are great, but without execution they are just ideas

 - Trust - We are trusted to deliver with integrity. We offer trust by default, and do not wait for it to be earned. We foster an environment where everyone trusts each other.

 - Community - Nobody is smarter than everybody. We embrace diversity of thought. We are 'open source first, upstream first' where collaboration benefits all. We uphold meritocracy by welcoming all participants & rewarding results

 - Any insight into career journey and background (from both notes and transcript).

 - Any metrics and numbers, such as team sizes, sales performance by revenue or growth (from both notes and transcript). Bullet point this output



Where relevant, use 'Level Map.csv' to provide context to the candidate's experience and responsibilities, aligning their background with typical responsibilities and impact at similar levels within the organization.



Candidate Motivations (In-Depth Analysis)

 - Clearly identify and articulate the candidate's reasons for seeking a new role (from both notes and transcript).

 - Provide specific examples or direct quotes from the interview to illustrate these motivations (from both notes and transcript).

 - Elaborate on the push and pull factors influencing the candidate's decision (from both notes and transcript).



Desired Role Aspects (Detailed Elaboration)

 - Detail what the candidate is looking for in their next position (from both notes and transcript).

 - Include specific preferences regarding company culture, role responsibilities, and opportunities for growth (from both notes and transcript).

 - Where possible, connect these desires to the candidate's past experiences and career trajectory (from both notes and transcript).



Undesired Role Aspects (Explicit and Contextual)

 - Explicitly mention what the candidate wants to avoid in a new role (from both notes and transcript).

 - Provide context by explaining why these aspects are undesirable to the candidate, drawing on their previous experiences or career goals (from both notes and transcript).



Competency-Based Question Analysis (Situation, Task, Action, Result with Specifics)

For each competency question (e.g., 'tell me about', 'give me an example of', 'describe to me'), capture in-depth notes focusing on:

 - Situation:The context of the candidate's example, including relevant background information and specific details of the scenario (from both notes and transcript).

 - Task:The specific goal or responsibility the candidate had to achieve within the described situation, detailing the objective or problem they were tasked with solving.

 - Action: Their specific actions, decisions, and contributions, with a focus on 'how' and 'why.' Use direct quotes or paraphrased statements to illustrate the candidate's approach (from both notes and transcript).

 - Result: The impact or outcomes of their actions, quantifying achievements where possible and detailing the broader consequences of their involvement (from both notes and transcript).

Framework Alignment: Analyze the candidate's responses against the competency definitions in 'Comp Def.csv' to assess their proficiency level.

- Where possible, compare the demonstrated proficiency level with the expected level for the target role (if known) using 'Comp Map.csv.'

- Explicitly reference the relevant competency definitions and level descriptions from the provided files to assess how the candidate's responses align with the organization's expectations.



Balanced/Constructive Feedback (Nuanced and Actionable)

 - Include a point that highlights either a potential concern or an area that requires further exploration with the candidate.

 - Frame this feedback in a way that is both balanced (acknowledging strengths) and constructive (suggesting areas for development or further discussion).

 - Provide specific examples or evidence from the interview to support the feedback.

Where appropriate, use the career framework to inform feedback, suggesting development areas based on competency gaps or highlighting strengths aligned with the framework.



In addition to the provided interview notes and transcript, you may also find attached the Job Description (JD) for the role the candidate is being interviewed for. If the JD is included, use it, along with the provided career framework files ('Comp Def.csv', 'Comp Map.csv', and 'Level Map.csv'), to further enrich the assessment. Specifically, if the JD is available, use it to:

 - Understand the specific requirements, responsibilities, and expectations of the target role.

 - Align the candidate's experience, motivations, and desired role aspects with the requirements of this specific job.

 - Refine the competency analysis by comparing the candidate's demonstrated skills and experience against the required competencies and levels outlined in both the JD and the career framework files.

 - Inform the 'Balanced/Constructive Feedback' section by identifying potential gaps or strong alignments between the candidate's profile and the JD.



Exclusions:

 - Do not include any compensation information.

 - Do not include any introductory pitch about SUSE or the specific role.

 - Do not include questions asked by the interviewer

 - Do not reference the csv files used



Output Goal:

 - The final notes should provide the Hiring Team with a deeper understanding of the candidate beyond their CV, showcasing the thoroughness and quality of the assessment - including reference to competency levels, career level, cultural value alignment and relevance to the role (if the Job Description is provided)

 - Produce this structured output with a high level of detail and comprehensive analysis.

 - Maintain a professional and consistent tone throughout the notes.
